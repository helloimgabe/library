# The Odin Library

## A simple web application to manage a collection of books. This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum and demonstrates key JavaScript and DOM manipulation concepts.

## Features

    -Book Management: Store book data in a JavaScript array.

    -Dynamic Display: View all books from the library array on the page as individual cards.

    -Add New Books: Use a form to add a new book with details like author, title, page count, and read status.

    -Remove Books: Delete a book from the library with a dedicated button on each book card.

    -Update Status: Change a book's "read" status with a toggle button.

    -Unique Identifiers: Each book has a unique ID, ensuring proper data management and element association.

## Core Concepts

    -Object Constructors: The project uses a Book constructor to create new book objects.

    -Arrays: All book objects are stored in a central array.

    -DOM Manipulation: Functions are written to dynamically create, display, and update book cards on the webpage based on the data in the array.

    -Event Handling: The application handles user interactions, such as form submissions, and button clicks, using event listeners to prevent default browser behavior and trigger custom functions.

    -Data Attributes: Data attributes are used to link the visual representation of a book on the page to its corresponding object in the data array.
